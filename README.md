# Chicago Public Library (CPL) - Home Library Project

This repo contains code that maps every census tract in the city of Chicago to each of the CPL's 81 branches. This helps to establish a definition of a "home" library to identify the expected user demographic based on proximity and community characteristics (such as population size and demographics) that each branch should serve.

The definition of a home library allows CPL to identify users who utilize their home branch and those who do not, in order to refine resources and programs offered at each branch based on user preferences and usage patterns.
